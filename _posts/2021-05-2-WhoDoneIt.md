A Platformer/Metroidvania made in Unity as part of a 3-day Game Jam. This Game Jam had no theme and I made this to test out my skills making a 2D game. 

The main features were implemented as:-
- A 2D Rigidbody character controller with a Camera following it. Extensive work was put in to tweak the Player to provide a smooth movement.
- A Smooth camera which lerps to the player position but is bound to the confines of the current room. All of this was done via Code without using third-party Plugins.
- A Modular Room system where enemies are allotted a room in the world environment and they are reset/turned off based on the room the player is in. This was done mainly to save processing power.
- A Simple Dash functions as an alternate form of movement and also a mode of interaction with the world. The Dash would also be used to open doors and thus act as a versatile action available to the player.

I have further broken down the development process in this blog that I wrote after said Game Jam at https://gds.sntiitk.in/2020/09/20/fall-game-jam.html
